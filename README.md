## Boston Housing Dataset: Linear Regression Model
### Introduction
This is a linear regression model on the Boston Housing dataset, which is available in the sklearn.datasets module in Python. The dataset contains information about various housing features in the Boston area, such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and median value of owner-occupied homes. The goal of this model is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on the other features in the dataset.

##  Iris Dataset: Random Forest Classifier
### Introduction
This is a random forest classifier on the Iris dataset, which is also available in the sklearn.datasets module in Python. The dataset contains information about various features of different types of iris flowers, such as sepal length, petal width, and species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). The goal of this model is to classify the iris flowers based on their features and species.
